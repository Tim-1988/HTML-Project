    <h2>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h2>

    <p>Dear Eileen,<br><br>
    Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part<br> 
    of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

    
    <h2>Starting dates</h2>

    <p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you<br>
        could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates of each one are as follows:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>First semester: 9 september 2016</li>
        <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
        <li>Third Semester: 2 May 2017</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please let me know of this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.<br> You can find more information about 
    <a href="https://www.mail.ru">important university dates</a> on our website.</p>


    <h2>Subjects of study</h2>

    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects fall<br>
        somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just<br>
        the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued<br>
        by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on perfomance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30<sup>o</sup>C</li>(86<sup>o</sup>F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> > 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
        <li><ins>HTML</ins> and <ins>CSS</ins> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ol>
    
    
    <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the<br> 
        research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>
    
<h2> Exotic dance moves</h2>

<p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <em>did</em> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,<br>
my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>

<p>Polynesian chicken dance</p>
    <blockquote>A little known but <em>very</em> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around<br>
    in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitfull". </blockquote>
<p>Icelandic brownian shuffle</p>
    <blockquote>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which<br>
    involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably<br>
    tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired<br>
    modern styles such as Twerking.</blockquote>
<p>Arctic robot dance</p>
    <blockquote>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have<br>
    discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants<br>
    of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this<br>
    because they were really cold.</blockquote>
    <br>
